Fashion Recommendations using Image Features
A fashion recommendation system using image feature extraction is a technology that analyzes the visual content of fashion items (such as clothing, accessories) to recommend similar or complementary products to users.

The provided dataset consists of images of womenâ€™s fashion items, including a wide variety of clothing and accessories. Each image represents a unique item, categorized by type (e.g., dresses, tops, skirts), style (e.g., casual, formal, sporty), and other attributes like color and pattern. The images are collected in a uniform format to facilitate the process of feature extraction and analysis.

The primary objective is to develop a fashion recommendation system that can analyze an input fashion item image and recommend similar items from the dataset based on visual similarity. The system should:

Extract Features: Utilize a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to extract comprehensive features from each image in the dataset, capturing aspects such as texture, color, and shape.
Measure Similarity: Implement a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) to quantitatively compare the extracted features of the input image against those of the images in the dataset.
Recommend Items: Based on the similarity scores, identify and recommend the top N items that are visually similar to the input item.
